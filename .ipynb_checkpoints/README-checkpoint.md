## Door-Glass-and-Falling-Audio-Classification
The project is tasks to create a model that can identify the class of a given audio particularly, classes
based on the title of the project. The process in summary begins with a 30 second audio wav format 
that would be seperated then sampled as a 3 seconds clip from the wave file. There are multiple methods and 
techniques that have been serialized to help extract features from the audio file. All of these methods boils
down into a general convertion and that is the spectogram. The techniques allows us to reintroduce the problem
to solving it to a more well established field of machine learning. There are several models that we can used to
conduct computer vision on the spectogram but in this project, we will limit the scope that would be listed in
the section below.
